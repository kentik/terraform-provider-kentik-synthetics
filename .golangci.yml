    # EXC0002 revive: Annoying issue about not having a comment. The rare codebase has such comments
    - (comment on exported (method|function|type|const)|should have( a package)? comment|comment should be of the form)
    # tparallel: Parallel subtests are not always desirable
    - subtests should call t\.Parallel
  exclude-use-default: false

# Disabled linters:
# - cyclop - duplicates functionality of gocyclo
# - exhaustivestruct - breaks "Make the zero value useful" proverb, meant to be used only for special cases
# - funlen - not needed - gocyclo ensures that functions complexity is not too high
# - godox - requires all TODOs to be removed - too strict
# - golint - deprecated (since v1.41.0) due to: The repository of the linter has been archived by the owner
# - gomoddirectives - does not allow "replace" directives - too strict
# - goerr113 - following check is too strict: "do not define dynamic errors, use wrapped static errors instead",
#              the check cannot be disabled
# - interfacer - deprecated (since v1.38.0) due to: The repository of the linter has been archived by the owner
# - maligned - deprecated (since v1.38.0) due to: The repository of the linter has been archived by the owner
# - mnd - extracting all numbers to constants is counter-productive
# - nlreturn - leads to using too many line breaks
# - paralleltest - considered a premature optimization
# - prealloc - considered a premature optimization
# - scopelint - deprecated (since v1.39.0) due to: The repository of the linter has been deprecated by the owner
# - thelper - enforcing t.Helper() everywhere is too strict
# - wsl - leads to using too many line breaks
